## Overview

**OpFlow** (运筹) is an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) for partial differential equation (PDE) solver composing.
It adopts the meta programming facilities provided by modern C++ extensively to provide an expressive front-end user
interface. With **expression templates** and **stencil auto-generation**, OpFlow is able to perform both **explicit** expression
evaluation and **implicit** linear system solving. With isolated expression, operator & evaluation engine's implementation,
OpFlow makes the algorithm, data structure and execution scheduler fully decoupled. OpFlow's advantages are:

- **Fully static**. No dynamic dispatching on the critical path
- **Zero-cost abstraction**. All operations are well-defined at compile time and force inlined
- **Automatic parallelization**. Partition & evaluation of expressions are automatically parallelized by user defined strategies
- **Implicit equation solving**. OpFlow can solve arbitrary user provided implicit equations as long as they are well-defined
- **Header only & C++ embedded**. OpFlow itself is header-only and embedded in C++. It's straight forward to integrate
  OpFlow into existing numerical codes
- **Mathematical API notations**. The front-end interface of OpFlow is very similar to mathematical notations. Little
  language noise will occur while writing equations
- **Proper level of abstraction**. OpFlow tries to eliminate the need to write bare schemes while keeping all the
  transformations & operations performed at the front-end. It's straight forward to see how each term is discretized,
  while keeping all expressions in a unified fashion. This is different from packing all things into modules, or
  looping over each element on the front stage.

## Quick start

0. Install all dependencies:

- Linux: (Ubuntu for example)
```bash
sudo apt install -y gcc-10 g++-10
```
- macOS: (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install gcc
```
1. Configure
```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-10 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-10 -DOPFLOW_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..
```
2. Build & Run
```bash
cmake --build . -t CONV1D && ./examples/CONV1D/CONV1D
```
## Installation

Please refer to the documentation for installation instructions.


## Acknowledgement
I specially thank the JetBrains company to provide a free [Open Source development license](https://jb.gg/OpenSourceSupport) to support the
development of OpFlow. CLion is a great cross-platform IDE for C/C++ development. I highly recommend you to try OpFlow out with it.
