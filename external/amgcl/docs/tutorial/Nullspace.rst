Using near null-space vectors
-----------------------------

Using near null-space vectors may greately improve the quality of the
aggregation AMG preconditioner. For the elasticity or structural problems the
near-null space vectors may be computed as rigid body modes from the
coordinates of the discretization grid nodes. In this tutorial we will use the
system obtained by discretization of a 3D elasticity problem modeling a
connecting rod:

   :name: connrod_msh

   The connecting rod geometry with the computed displacements

The dataset was kindly provided by David Herrero PÃ©rez (`@davidherreroperez
<https://github.com/davidherreroperez>`_) in the issue `#135
<https://github.com/ddemidov/amgcl/issues/135>`_ on Github and is
available for download at `doi:10.5281/zenodo.4299865
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4299865>`_. The system matrix is symmetric, has
block structure with small :math:`3\times3` blocks, and
has 81,657 rows and 3,171,111 nonzero values (about 39 nonzero entries per row
on average). The matrix portrait is shown on the figure below:

   The nonzero portrait of the connecting rod system.

It is possible to solve the system using the CG iterative solver preconditioned
with the smoothed aggregation AMG, but the convergence is not that great::

However, since this is an elasticity problem and we know the coordinates for
the discretization mesh, we can compute the rigid body modes and provide them
as the near null-space vectors for the smoothed aggregation AMG method. AMGCL
has a convenience function :cpp:func:`amgcl::coarsening::rigid_body_modes()`
that takes the 2D or 3D coordinates and converts them into the rigid body
modes. The `examples/solver`_ utility allows to specify the file containing the
coordinates on the command line::

In the 3D case we get 6 near null-space vectors corresponding to the rigid body
modes. Note that this makes the preconditioner more expensive memory-wise: the
memory footprint of the preconditioner has increased to 132M from 70M in the
simplest case and 92M in the case using the block structure of the matrix. But
this pays up in terms of performance: the number of iterations dropped from 197
to 63 and the solution time decreased from 3.2 seconds to 1.2 seconds.

.. _examples/ns_search.cpp: https://github.com/ddemidov/amgcl/blob/master/examples/ns_search.cpp

In principle, it is also possible to approximate the near null-space vectors by
solving the homogeneous system :math:`Ax=0`, starting with a random initial
solution :math:`x`. We may use the computed :math:`x` as a near-null space
vector, solve the homogeneous system again from a different random start, and
do this until we have enough near null-space vectors. The
`examples/ns_search.cpp`_ example shows how to do this. However, this process
is quite expensive, because we need to solve the system multiple times,
starting with a badly tuned solver at that. It is probably only worth the time
in case one needs to solve the same system efficiently for multiple right-hand
side vectors. Below is an example of searching for the 6 near null-space
vectors::

This is an improvement with respect to the version that only uses the blockwize
structure of the matrix, but is about 50% less effective than the version using
the grid coordinates in order to compute the rigid body modes.

The listing below shows the complete source code computing the near null-space
vectors from the mesh coordinates and using the vectors in order to improve the
quality of the preconditioner. We include the
``<amgcl/coarsening/rigid_body_modes.hpp>`` header to bring the definition of
the :cpp:func:`amgcl::coarsening::rigid_body_modes()` function in line 9, and
use the function to convert the 3D coordinates into the 6 near null-space
vectors (rigid body modes) in lines 65--66. In lines 37--38 we check that the
coordinate file has the correct dimensions (since each grid node has three
displacement components associated with the node, the coordinate file should
have three times less rows than the system matrix). The rest of the code should
be quite familiar.

As was noted above, using the near null-space vectors makes the preconditioner
less memory-efficient: since the 6 rigid-body modes are used as null-space
vectors, every fine-grid aggregate is converted to 6 unknowns on the coarser
level. The following figure shows the structure of the system matrix on the
second level of the hierarchy, and it is obvious that the matrix has
:math:`6\times6` block structure:

   The nonzero portrait of the system matrix on the second level of the AMG
   hierarchy.

It should be possible to represent both the initial matrix and the matrices on
each level of the hiearachy using the :math:`3\times3` block value type, as we
did in the :doc:`Structural problem <Serena>` example. Unfortunaltely, AMGCL is
not yet able to utilize near null-space vectors with block-valued backends.

One possible solution to this problem, suggested by Piotr Hellstein (`@dokotor
<https://github.com/dokotor>`_) in GitHub issue `#215
<https://github.com/ddemidov/amgcl/issues/215>`_, is to convert the matrices to
the block-wise storage format after the hiearchy has been constructed. This has
been implemented in form of the :doc:`hybrid OpenMP and VexCL backends
</components/backends>`.

The listing below shows an example of using the hybrid OpenMP backend
(`tutorial/5.Nullspace/nullspace_hybrid.cpp`_). The only difference with the
scalar_ code is the definition of the block value type and the use of the
hybrid backend (lines 46--49).

.. _tutorial/5.Nullspace/nullspace_hybrid.cpp: https://github.com/ddemidov/amgcl/blob/master/tutorial/5.Nullspace/nullspace_hybrid.cpp

   :caption: Using hybrid OpenMP backend while providing near null-space vectors.
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5,46-49

This results in the following output. Note that the memory footprint of the
preconditioner dropped from 98M to 41M (by 58%), and the solution time dropped
from 1.150s to 0.707s (by 38%)::

Another possible solution is to use a block-valued backend both for constructing
the hierarchy and for the solution phase. In order to allow for the coarsening
scheme to use the near null-space vectors, the
:cpp:class:`amgcl::coarsening::as_scalar` coarsening wrapper may be used. The
wrapper converts the input matrix to scalar format, applies the base coarsening
strategy to the scalar matrix, and converts the computed transfer operators
back to block format. This approach results in faster setup times, since every
other operation besides coarsening is performed using block arithmetics.

The listing below shows an example of using the :cpp:class:`amgcl::coarsening::as_scalar`
wrapper (`tutorial/5.Nullspace/nullspace_block.cpp`_). The system matrix is
converted to block format in line 78 in the same way it was done in the
:doc:`Structural problem <Serena>` tutorial. The RHS and the solution vectors are
reinterpreted to contain block values in lines 94-95. The SPAI0 relaxation here
resulted in the increased number of interations, so we used the ILU(0)
relaxaion.

This results are presented below. Note that even though the more advanced ILU(0)
smoother was used, the setup time has been reduced, since ILU(0) was
constructed using block arithmetics.::
